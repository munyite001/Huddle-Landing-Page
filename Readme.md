## Overview
This challenge was on a junior level. I had completed it earlier but I decided to redo it, given my whole new css confidence

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

## My process
I have been practicing with Mobile first workflow, for some time now, so as always my process:
- Analyse the design visually
- Figure out how the mobile design will be achieved
- Figure out how the desktop design will be achieved
- Understand how they'll all interact
- Build out the mobile design
- Build out the desktop design
- Add addition features like active states and hover pseudo classes

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Well for starters, design is not as easy as it looks.
 I am also continuing to improve on mobile first work-flow


### Continued development

I want to continue improing on mobile first work-flow.
I also want to work on measurement units, to understand better how Rem and Em work
